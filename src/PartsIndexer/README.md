# PartsIndexer

A tool that looks through every clothes elu and saves the individual parts names in an XML file. This file is used by the dynamic clothes loading mechanism and is necessary for it to work, since there's no other way of efficiently retrieving the names of parts.

Usage of PartIndexer.exe:
Place in the root of the folder that contains all the elu files you want to index and run PartIndexer.exe.
PartIndexer.exe will scan all subfolders for elu files.
